# Ross Dashboard Panels
A repository of custom panels for use in Ross Dashboard that I have made available.

# AJA Ki Pro.grid:
You can control your AJA Ki Pro recording device within Dashboard using this panel.

# Panasonic PTZ Control.grid
You can control your Panasonic AW-HE40 PTZ camera with this panel.

# VideoHub Control.grid
You can control your Blackmagic VideoHub router with this panel. Supports loading of input and output labels.

# Countdowns.grid
Using the accompanying clock.html file, you can run some basic countdowns with this panel. The clock.html file should be in a subfolder called "clock".

# Outlet Control.grid
Use this panel to send a TCP message to turn on or off a network-based power outlet. Currently supports TP-Link HS100/101 models.

# Companion Satellite UT.grid
Use this panel to emulate a Companion Satellite Surface in Dashboard. It's sized for an UltriTouch (UT) but you can edit it to resize as needed.
